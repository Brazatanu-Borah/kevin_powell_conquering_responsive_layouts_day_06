EM : not good for typography sizing
em : depends on the parent elements font-size

  >> so it keeps on multiplying with each successive nesting of html elements

  >> compounding effect

** Use 'rem' for typography sizing





BUT em's are good for 'padding' on buttons, margin that references the font-size of the content and other edge cases

  >> the padding/margin on the button changes relative to the font size of the button
